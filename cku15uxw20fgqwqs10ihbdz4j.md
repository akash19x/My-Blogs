## Getting Started with Python and the beautiful road ahead

Learning to code has the power to create something that can bring a good change in people's lives.
Anyone who knows how to code can make such creations. A century earlier, it was not possible as resources were rare but we are one lucky generation to have that opportunity.

With this thought, let me introduce you to one of the programming languages of present and future and that is **Python**

### What really is Python programming in simple words? ðŸ˜Œ

Python is simply a programming language which basically means through this, we give our computers a set of instructions to execute.

Python is used in creating a variety of stuffs like **websites, machine learning models, automating tasks, game development, web scraping, data science, business applications** etc.

It also has a wide range of libraries that we can import whenever we need some particular feature. It makes python flexible and allows us to use various libraries to create some cool stuffs. 

For now, this is enough.

### **How is Python compared to other languages?**

- Python is **easy to learn**! The syntax is relatively simple compared to  programming languages which makes it easy to get started with even with no prior experience in coding.

- Python is free and open-source which basically means it's code is freely available to the public on repositories (a place to store code on internet)

- Python might be slow than some programming languages like Java and C but it's memory management and lesser lines of code makes up for it. :)

### Some Applications of Python and libraries used :

### Web Development
Web Development basically means building a frontend (User Interface that interacts with the clients or users) and a backend (which contains business logic and interacts with a database). <br>

**Some popular python web frameworks : 
** <br> <br>1- **Flask :** Flask is a lightweight microframework,which means that we add extensions and libraries that we need as per our code requirements without being provided by the framework from start. It makes our application highly flexible.<br> Flask is highly used in industries for web development and REST APIs.<br> <br> 2- **Django : 
** Django is a Python web framework that offers is a high-level framework and involves fast and clean development and design. It is very fast, flexible and secure. It is also used alot in various companies like Instagram and Sportify.

### Machine Learning 
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It is the technology of present and future as the data available is vast and we can predict the future by analysing the past data.

<br>** Some Machine Learning Frameworks : ** <br> <br> 
1- **Pandas : ** Pandas is a python library used for data manipulation and analysis. 
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. <br><br> In simple words, if you want to do anything data related in Python, Pandas is the backbone of it and it is really easy to learn!<br><br>
2- **Matplotlib : ** It is a data visualisation library used to make various plots and charts based on the data. The plots can be 2D or 3D and it gives functionalities of variety of charts like bar graph, pire chart, histograms, funnel chart, line plot etc in a very few steps. <br><br>
3- **Scikit-learn: **Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. This 
 library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modelling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.  <br><br>
4- **Tensorflow :** TensorFlow is a Python library for fast numerical computing. It was created and released by **Google**. It is a foundation library that can be used to create Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow. <br><br>
5- **Keras :** Keras is a powerful and easy-to-use free open source Python library for developing and evaluating deep learning models. It wraps the efficient numerical computation libraries Theano and TensorFlow and allows you to define and train neural network models in just a few lines of code.<br>Yeah the last two are pretty cool once you get into it. 

### Web Scraping 
A web scraper is a specialised tool designed to accurately and quickly extract data from a website for data analysis.

<br>** Some Web Scraping Frameworks : ** <br> <br> 
1- **Scrapy : ** Scrapy is an open source web scraping library for python which is used to used 
in monitoring and mining data, as well as automated and systematic testing. It is actually used when we want to do a large scale web scraping and perform some tests along the way. <br><br>
2- **Beautiful Soup :** It is used to extract useful information from HTML and pages. It is based on parsing and parsers helps us to get the data from such files. It can also detect the type of encoding a web page has and can get more reliable information. <br><br>
3- **Requests : ** It is an HTTP library which is used for API purposes, which allows the user to sent requests to the HTTP server and GET response back in the form of HTML or JSON response.<br><br>
4- **Urllib :** Urllib is a Python library that allows the developer to open and parse information from HTTP or FTP protocols. It comes with python so you might not have to install it! :)

### Game Development ðŸ˜Ž
The increase and advancements of gaming industry is Python has some frameworks which can be used for game development as well. Some of the very popular video games are coded in python like **Civilization-IV, Disneyâ€™s Toontown Online** etc have been built using Python.  and here is some of the libraries that can get you started with it. 

![Game_Development.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1632655520231/8mmd_FsGy.png)
1- **Pygame :** It is an open source python library which enables users to build fully featured games as well as multimedia programs with Python programming. It is highly portable and runs on nearly every platform and operating system.<br> <br>

2- **Panda3D :** It is an open source python library written in Python and C++ and it is used for realtime 3D games, visualisations, simulations, experiments and more. <br><br>

3- **PyKyra :** It is one of the fastest game development frameworks for Pythone. Along with the standard features of this framework, it also supports MPEG video and sound such as mp3, ogg vorbis, .wav, etc. <br><br>
There are many other game development libraries like : **Pyglet, Python-Ogre, PyOpenGL, Kivy, Cocos2d** etc which you can checkout as well.
<br> <br>

#### Python is also used for Data Science, Business Applications, Creating GUIs, Automating tasks etc. The scope is endless! 

### Opportunities with Learning PythonðŸ˜‡

- **Data Science** is a booming field currently and as we have lots of data collected now that it has ever been, companies need professionals to study the data, do predictive analysis and share insights that how they can improve the product and Python is currently the best language to perform this skill and it is a job that keeps growing with time.

- ** Artificial Intelligence, Natural language Processing (NLP) and Big Data ** are technologies of the future and they bank heavily on their implementation in python.

- Many leading organisations like Instagram, Spotify, Amazon, Disney, Youtube, Facebook etc have a large part of their codebases in python.

### Conclusion

Python is the language of the present and future. It is going no-where. If you are already learning python that's really cool and if you're new to this then you can deep dive learning this programming languages where opportunities are  endless and resources are easily available! 

Thanks for reading ðŸ˜„ Happy Coding! ðŸ˜Œ
