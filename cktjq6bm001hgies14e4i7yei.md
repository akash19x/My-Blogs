## My journey in Technical writing with missed opportunities, failed blog and rebuilding with hashnode

Hey folks! I've started writing blogs on Hashnode since august this year and this is not the first time i'm writing something. Let me take you to the time when I was in school and was really interested in writing and I even did wrote some good essays. 
But guess what? I stopped doing so. Why? Because apparently some of my friends back in the days thought that was really uncool thing to do and I really stopped because of "what other people think of me" syndrome.

### My First Blogging Experience (Faliure)
Now let me fast forward years later, in college where I wanted to grab every opportunity I could and I did. I published some technical papers in computer science and started my blog - https://techbies.tech.blog where I added my paper, some interview experiences, programming questions walk through etc. 
But this time the problems I faced were : 

- Lack of consistency

- I gave up too easily because others did not read my blog (That's what I thought )

- I knew writing (had good ideas) but failed to get the proper execution and right audience and community

And so, I blew it and thought writing is not for me.


### What made me write again?

One of the days I went to the analytics from previous blog and I saw about 150-170 people have read it in a month that too without any sharing to my social networks.
But only one of my blog posts was the centre of attention as others only gained 2-5 views in same month.
That made me realise maybe I was doing the **right things in a wrong way **.

I told myself that I made a mistake by stopping to write as it might actually help someone not now but maybe in future. I also realised that this piece of article is mine and nobody can take that away from me. 

I want to learn more, I want to grow more and I want to write more and since then I have been much active on the social media and keep on reading some really good bloggers and what approach they follow.

### My re-entry in Blogging with Hashnode

Through twitter I came to know about a blogging platform called hashnode. I also knew many of my twitter mutuals have already had accounts and were writing their own blogs as well.

Then what? I've made an account and been writing here since last 1 and a half months. It's really easy to manage and share my writings and in as short time, I have more visitors that my previous blog did in six months.

I've grown a lot and this is an opportunity that I should cash in, to grow.

### Hashnode Bootcamp

Hashnode bootcamp came at perfect timing for me as I have a very less experience on this platform and I can do much better by learning how other people do. It's also a great chance to be a part of this amazing community and grow along with then.

I really can't wait for all these bootcamp sessions and looking forward to my journey here! 


Thanks for your read! :) Good to be a part of this community.
