## Top Tech company which I'd like to work for as a Technical Writer

Ever since I've been into software background, I have used a lot of products which have made my life easier with the exceptional service they provide. This article is focused on one company whose products  I use on a regular basis and I'd be more than honoured to write articles for them or even work for some day.

It's **Hashnode**. I know, highly predictable but it deserves to be on the top of my list because of the amazing work they are doing.

I'm starting to write about the company on the same company's platform. How cool is that? ðŸ˜Ž

"**Hashnode is a one-stop platform to start blogging as a developer. Start a blog. Share knowledge, attain creator independence, and grow your career.**"  

That's what I get from a quick google search. 
But there's actually more to this as it helps all sort of people whether they are creators or readers or just someone who is looking to be a part of the community.

### How hashnode helps people?

- **Writing Blogs : ** Hashnode provides a perfect platform for anyone who wants to write blogs. Anyone who wants to write content can get started very quickly as it is very easy to get started and the person (if he/she is not into frontend or website customisation) will find it like writing posts. <br> There is also a beautiful customisation of the blog which is available, analytics, domain connection, SEO etc all for free of cost. 

- **Learning : ** Hashnode is growing rapidly and so are the number of technical writers on this platform. People write about all sorts of technologies, tutorials, how-to guides etc and content is increasing day by day. If someone who wants to grasp the knowledge about all sorts of latest developments happening in the tech community,  hashnode is the perfect place to be as the articles are straight to the point, with a really cool interface and a great community support.

- **Being a part of community : ** The writers of hashnode are very helpful and I'm saying it from a personal experience. It is like a social media of creative tech bloggers who are willing to help and provide feedback. Knowing and networking with such amazing content creators can really help an individual and also motivate the person to contribute with the community and be a better writer or a learner.

### Future of Hashnode (my personal opinion)? 

With the increase in the technology boom and also the number of content creators, hashnode provides a great opportunity for people to share their knowledge and grow.

Hashnode  is something which I believe will grow alot when more people contribute on it and it's inevitable as everyone wants to grow and learn. 

One of the cool things I find about hashnode is many writers are really passionate about latest developments in tech industry and world in general and they have started writing about it. Technologies like **Web3**, Blockchain, Web Development, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is the future and on this platform one can see multiple blogs related to these and different ways to do the same thing which really opens up lots of possibilities.

### Conclusion

I really feel this is the era of people wanting to be creators and create thing on their own and hashnode is a great platform to publish their ideas and grow in general. I'm really happy that I discovered this platform in the last few months and am contributing ever since as it is making me learn things, retain my knowledge and be a better writer. I hope someday I write a blog at **hashnode's townhall**! ðŸ˜Ž
